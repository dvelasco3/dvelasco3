As a Biological Science Technician with experience in the United States Forest Service and the University of Arizona, I have gained a wide range of skills in wildlife observation and monitoring, data collection and analysis, and habitat improvement projects. I have worked with a variety of species including small mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. I have also gained experience in machine learning and artificial intelligence, including the use of programming languages such as Python to research and train Convolutional Neural Networks for object detection and the analysis of JavaScript object notation files. In my roles, I have demonstrated strong compliance with safety rules and regulations and have excelled in both independent and team-based projects. I am adept at summarizing and analyzing data, preparing reports and recommendations, and assembling information for the development of plans and coordination of resource information for analytical reports.
